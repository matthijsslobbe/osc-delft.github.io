  expertise: Airborne Wind Energy
  motivation: 'I have worked for many years in the field of computational fluid dynamics, where good code and data management is crucial, and where sharing of data (for example, for benchmarking different solvers) has a long tradition. In my view, data sharing is an important extension of the concept of scientific peer review, enabling peers to retrace analyses and build on them. Without having access to the original data and source code this is generally very difficult or not possible at all. In my recent work on airborne wind energy, an emerging renewable energy technology, I have also learned that the quality of the data has a large impact on its reusability. We scientists tend to focus on the things that are of highest interest at the moment when we conduct an experiment or a computational simulation. We often neglect to record or store data that is not of immediate interest but that can potentially become interesting or very important later. I have realized this, for example, when working on a project supported by the Data Refinement Fund of the 4TU Centre for Research Data. In this project we assembled the data recordings and associated photo and video footage of five years of flight testing with our pioneering 20 Kilowatt kite power system, with the objective of making this data available to the broader research community. While it was relatively straightforward to compile the original data recordings, it was a painstaking detective work and not always possible to retrace and properly identify data that was not recorded but only written down in log files, or documented by the photo and video footage. However, it was important for anyone who wants to reuse the data. A good data management strategy would have helped address these issues. But luckily we have learned from these experiences.

Proactive sharing of high quality research data is an important ingredient of an efficient networked R&D road map. Especially for emerging technologies a good management & sharing strategy can really make a difference and contribute to a rapid advancement of the research agenda. For example, data sharing can enable researchers of different research teams to cross-validate their modeling frameworks and thus more rapidly improve the quality of the models. I am convinced that industry will ultimately benefit from such high quality modeling tools. From 2015 until 2018 I have coordinated the EU Horizon 2020 doctoral training network AWESCO, with a total of 16 PhD researchers at 12 European partner institutions, and as part of this project we had to develop, step-by-step a data management and sharing strategy. Since the project included not only academic partners but also industry, the sharing aspect especially was not an easy task. But we managed and successfully concluded the project with several collaborative research streams that produced and still continue to produce important results for the commercial development teams. As a data champion I would like to share my experiences with my fellow researchers.'

Alessandra-Menicucci:
  name: Alessandra Menicucci
  faculty: Faculty of Aerospace Engineering
  position: Assistant Professor
  department: Space Systems Engineering
  motivation: 'My research has been since the very beginning centered around data analysis, in particular the search for rare decays in particle physics or signature of dark matter in cosmic rays spectra. I believe that data management and sharing is of paramount importance not only for scientific discoveries, but also for improving the quality and efficiency of our daily work as engineers and researchers. Space industry is traditionally very conservative and reluctant to data openness: spacecraft design and test data are kept behind closed doors very rarely made available to the community. In order to face the challenges that space exploration presents to us, we need to modify this attitude and I believe that a new generation of space engineers formed with a solid understanding of big data management can make this change possible.'
  expertise: Micro-spacecraft system engineering, space instrumentation (radiation and space environment monitors, asteroid muography), space environment and effects analysis, space embedded systems.

    faculty: Aerospace Engineering
    position: Professor
    department: Control &amp; Operations
    motivation: 'The main reason is that I firmly believe in open science: sharing data, source code, and even hardware designs, allows others to reproduce your scientific experiments and findings with much less effort. Other researchers can then easily compare their work with yours, or build upon your work, so that together we can make much quicker progress. As a side-effect, it increases the impact of your work, both in terms of scientific citations and in terms of use by industry. Finally, providing open access to data and source code forces you to put in an additional effort in making it comprehensible and easy to use. This is not only useful to others, but also to yourself when you have to reuse it at a later date.'
    expertise: 'My main research focus is to achieve autonomous flight of swarms of tiny flying robots. In order to achieve this, I investigate computationally efficient artificial intelligence, which is very much inspired by the intelligence of small flying insects. My areas of expertise are: artificial intelligence, computer vision, and machine learning for robotics.'

Jacob-Hoogenboom:
    name: Jacob Hoogenboom
    faculty: Applied Sciences
    position: Associate Professor
    department: Imaging Physics
    motivation: 'In microscopy, we generate many images that help us draw conclusions we present in papers, but that can also contain data that is interesting for others, including researchers that do not have access to the high end machines we use. Often, a user-selected snapshot makes it into the paper while the context of the full datasets is lost. Making these full datasets publicly available can thus accelerate science, as they can be used by a wider group of scientists including those in places or countries where equipment is not available. Also, open data can be very useful for educational purposes, I am also using online biomedical data that we cannot generate here in Delft in one of my courses. I would like to share experiences with others and see what we can learn from each other. We are generating very big datasets that present a lot of challenges for making it publicly available, both in size, but also, e.g. metadata. Others can learn from what we are doing, and I would like to learn from the approaches others have been taking. I would also like to discuss questions like what data (raw, annotated, analyzed) should be made public? How should one be credited if someone else uses the data?I would also like to discuss examples of how we use open data in our lectures and assignments for students.'

    position: Associate Professor
    motivation: 'In the field of computational design and robotics in architecture, good code and data management are crucial and sharing of data for advancing ideas is necessary. Data sharing is also an important tool for scientific peer review, enabling peers to retrace analyses and eventually build on them. Without having access to the original data and source code this is generally very difficult or not possible. Furthermore, the quality of the data has a big impact on reusability. Assembling data recordings and associated photos and videos of the design to robotic production system, with the objective of making this data available to the broader research community is main motivation for data management and sharing. </p> <p class="bodytext">Proactive sharing of high-quality research data is an important aspect of a networked R&amp;D approach. Especially for emerging technologies, a good management and sharing strategy can really make a difference and contribute to a rapid advancement of the research. For example, data sharing can enable researchers of different research teams to cross-validate their modeling frameworks and thus more rapidly improve the quality of the models. The industry will also benefit from high-quality models. As a data champion I would like to share my experiences with fellow researchers and potential R&amp;D contributors.'

  name: Amir Ebrahimi Fard
  faculty: Digital Competence Center, ICT Innovation
  department: Multi-Actor Systems
  expertise: Social network data analysis, Machine learning, Anomaly detection, Natural language processing, Digital data collection, Python
  motivation: 'I believe one of the most important yet missing pieces in the current research landscape is data management. It facilitates and accelerates the research cycle by making the research activities findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (FAIR). Despite the significance of FAIR research, making a large university (with thousands of scholars and lots of ongoing research projects) fully FAIR at once might seem infeasible. That is why the role of data champion matters. They can smoothly bridge this gap by promoting data management practises among their colleagues. Besides the raising awareness, being a data champion provides the opportunity of learning about other or most recent data management techniques and practices. From a personal point of view, I am also very much interested in circulating data management tips among computational social scientists due to the recent tendency of both social scientists and scholars from hard disciplines to work on multidisciplinary projects.'
