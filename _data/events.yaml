- title: Distuptive conversations: Peer review under Pressure - how do we ensure research publications are of high quality?
  date_time: "Tuesday, April 18, 12:15-13:45 CET"
  location: X Delft, Body & Mind room
  content: |
         Would you like to know more about [open] peer review and the challenges with the process its results? Do you want to contribute to the conversation and improve the existing practices of peer review? Join this panel discussion to find out more.
         Originally designed as a way to provide “quality checks” in research, the practice of peer review has recently been a controversial subject of discussions. Researchers have raised questions such as whether peer review truly works to guarantee the quality of scientific work or merely provides a false stamp of approval, why peer reviewers do not review the data where mistakes are most commonly made, and whether peer review hinders scientific progress. In this panel discussion, we will examine the current state of the academic publishing system and several problems associated with the practice of peer review. We will also explore potential new ways to reinvent the quality control system of the 21st century that will best serve the needs of the scientific community.
         
         **Preliminary programme:**
         12.15 – 12.45: Networking and lunch
         12.45 – 12.50: Introduction

         13.05 – 13.45: Panel discussion: 
         **Moderator:** Frederique Belliard, Open Publishing Platform Project lead
         **Panellists:** to be confirmed
         During the panel discussion, the audience (in person and online) is free to ask questions/clarifications, make remarks

- title: Fairly Toolset Workshop
  date_time: "Wednesday, March 22, 13:30-17:30 CET"
  location: X TU Delft Mekelweg 8 Building 37 2628 CD Delft
  content: |
         Computational research environments facilitate research data production by providing the necessary processing and analysis tools. They are well connected to some research infrastructure, e.g. code repositories. But, their interoperability with research data repositories is weak, and the researchers need to manually upload their research data to the repositories, mostly through web forms and interfaces.
         The fairly toolset seamlessly integrates research environments and data repositories, and allows local data and metadata management, quick data publication, unattended data uploading, smart dataset synchronization, and quick dataset cloning. The toolset includes a Python library providing a standard API to manage and publish datasets on various data repository platforms (e.g. Zenodo, Figshare, 4TU.ResearchData), a command line tool that enables research data management without programming skills, and a JupyterLab extension to manage datasets through a graphical user interface.
         The toolset is relevant for researchers at all levels, data stewards, RSEs, data managers, and practically anyone who develops or manages research data and data repositories. The main target group of this event is the TU Delft community. But the invitation is open to research and support staff (specially DCC staff) from all universities in The Netherlands. During the workshop, we will present the toolset, train participants on how to use it to make research outputs FAIR, and collect feedback for improvement and further development.
         This event is sponsored by the Open Science Program and the Open Science Community of TU Delft via the Mainstreaming Open Science Fund. And co-organized by TU Delft Digital Competence Centre & Center of Expertise in Big Geodata Science, University of Twente.

        In the future we will use more energy, batteries will play a critical role in providing us with this energy. Sanli Faez is working on an Open Source Flow Battery to democratise the energy market. Sanli Feaz is an assistant professor at the University Utrecht and a big supporter of open science and open-source working. He records regular podcasts and is now one of the pioneers of making open flow batteries!

        We will also be showcasing some of the projects that have been built by the members of the Open Hardware community at Delft, these will include the Open Centrifuge, the Fume sensor, Raspberry Pi Computer Cluster and the award winning Plastic Scanner. Join us to know more about these projects or on how to work on your own!
